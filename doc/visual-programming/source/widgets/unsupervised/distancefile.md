Example
-------

When you want to use a custom-set distance file that you've saved before, open the **Distance File** widget and select the desired file with the *Browse* icon. This widget loads the existing distance file. In the snapshot below, we loaded the transformed *Iris* distance matrix from the [Save Distance Matrix](../unsupervised/savedistancematrix.md) example. We displayed the transformed data matrix in the [Distance Map](../unsupervised/distancemap.md) widget. We also decided to display a distance map of the original *Iris* dataset for comparison.
